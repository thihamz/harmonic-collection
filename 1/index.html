title: This is the first entry

<p>This is the content of the first entry. Jekyll will insert/combine this HTML into our <code>layout</code>(s)!</p>

<p>You can also call smaller pieces of HTML here, which Jekyll calls <code>includes</code>:</p>

{% include arrow-link.html title="Week 9" link="https://core-interaction.github.io/week/9/" %}

<p>You can use these for consistent, repeated HTML blocks.</p>
