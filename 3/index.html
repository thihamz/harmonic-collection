<p>You can use <em>structured data</em> in your <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/">front-matter</a>.</p>

<p>This is saved at the top of your <code>.md</code> files, in a data format called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML">YAML</a>—short for <em>Yet Another Markup Language</em>. (So many languages, I know.)</p>

<blockquote>Note that YAML/YML uses spaces for indentation, and will break with tabs character! I do this all the time.</blockquote>

<p>This data can then be accessed in your <code>layouts</code> and <code>includes</code> for consistent structure and formatting!</p>
